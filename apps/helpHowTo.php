The iai system is divided into two separate websites.  There is a client interface, available on the world wide web, and an in-house back-office product.  The process of receiving an order from the world wide web will be explained by this document.
<p />

The client interface is available at <a href='http://iai.newdledev.com/order'>http://iai.newdledev.com/order</a>.  The back office interface is available at <a href='http://iai.newdledev.com'>http://iai.newdledev.com</a>.
<p />

We have maintained the original site's look and feel.  It is the same interface that was designed in 2003.  The differences between the latest release of the website and the site designed in 2003 are as a majority back-end data connection changes.  The sequence of steps that occur during the process of an order have remained unchanged.  If you are familiar with the site as it existed, you will already know the information presented here.
