If you are a new customer, you'll need an account on our system.  The username and password you 
choose will be used to access and configure all aspects of your domain.  Any email accounts, web 
space, databases, and other options for your new domain will be associated with, or children of, 
this account.  Please choose a username between 3 and 12 characters using lowercase 
alphanumeric characters [a-z, 0-9] and enter it into the username field below.  Then pick a 
password longer than 4 characters which is easy for you to remember but is not a common word or
ID (names, dates, and government ID's are all bad passwords).  An easy way to create a good 
password is to think of a sentance between 5 and 8 words and use the first or second letter from
each word.  Enter your password choice in the field below and enter it again in the 'Verify' field
to ensure there are no typos.
