<h3><strong>Startup Incubators, Pitch Competitions, &amp; Seed Funding Programs</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Incubators</strong>&#8212;Incubators have mushroomed 
    in recent years, particularly in the web 2.0 space. 
    Most provide very small levels of funding (in the five-figure 
    range), coaching and exposure. Notable incubators include <strong><a href="http://www.techstars.org/">TechStars</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a>,</strong> and <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/"><strong>SeedCamp</strong></a> (UK). Others include the <a href="http://www.hatchery.vc"><strong>Hatchery</strong></a> (NYC) and <a href="http://www.capitalfactory.com/"><strong>Capital 
      Factory</strong></a> (Austin). A longer<a href="http://www.firstascentventures.com/blog/?p=26" target="_blank"> <strong>list of startup incubators</strong></a> can 
    be found <a href="http://www.firstascentventures.com/blog/?p=26"><strong>here.</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong>Platform Funding</strong>&#8212;Many large technology companies have set up incubation programs 
    for coders developing on their platforms. Examples include 
    Facebook's <a href="http://fbfund.com/"><strong>fbFund REV</strong></a>, 
    Google's<strong><a href="http://www.google.com/gadgetventures/">Gadget 
      Ventures</a></strong>, and RIM's <strong><a href="http://www.blackberrypartnersfund.com/" target="_blank">Blackberry developer fund. </a></strong> Amazon has a competition 
    for startups that use its <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/startupchallenge/"><strong>AWS 
      web services</strong></a> platform, and PayPal  runs an annual <a href="https://www.x.com/community/ppx/devchallenge" target="_blank"><strong>Developer Challenge.</strong></a> Other companies<strong></strong>provide free or discounted 
    software, hosting, and other technical services to startups, 
    among them <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark/">Microsoft 
      BizSpark</a></strong> and <a href="http://www.sun.com/startupessentials/"><strong>Sun 
        Startup Essentials</strong></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Plan Competitions</strong>&#8212;Numerous business plan and pitch competitions have sprung up, and they are a great way to gain exposure, practice your pitch, get feedback, and in some cases, get money (without giving up equity). Many are run by b-schools, such as the <strong><a href="http://www.mootcorp.org/" target="_blank">University of Texas</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://bpc.wharton.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Wharton,</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://bplan.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.hbs.edu/entrepreneurship/bplan/" target="_blank">Harvard</a></strong>. Others are run by companies, such as <strong><a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/ventures/qprize/2010/" target="_blank">Qualcomm Ventures' &quot;QPrize&quot;</a></strong>, <a href="http://www.netimpact.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=2315" target="_blank"><strong>Wal-Mart </strong></a>, and <strong><a href="http://www.dfj.com/bizplan/" target="_blank">Cisco / DFJ.</a></strong> A longer list of <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/11/business/smallbusiness/Competitions-table.html" target="_blank">business plan competitions</a></strong> can be found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/11/business/smallbusiness/Competitions-table.html" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></li>
  <li><strong>VC Seed Programs</strong>&#8212;Several VC firms are 
    getting into the game with seed funding initiatives, 
    such as <a href="http://www.hcp.com/summer/"><strong>Highland 
      Capital's Summer@Highland</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://www.crv.com/quickstart/quickstart_faq">Charles 
        River Ventures QuickStart Loan</a></strong> program. Other dedicated 
    VC programs include Kleiner Perkins'<strong><a href="http://www.kpcb.com/initiatives/ifund/index.html">iFund</a></strong> (for iphone-based startups) and their <strong><a href="http://www.kpcb.com/initiatives/sfund/" target="_blank">sFund</a></strong> (for  social media startups), as well as   <a href="http://www.baypartners.com/seed/approach.htm"><strong>Bay 
      Partners' Seed Program</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="http://www.greylock.com/discovery/discovery/" target="_blank">Greylock Discovery Fund.</a></strong></li>
</ul>

  <li>Wall Street Journal's <strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/small-business" target="_blank">Startup.com</a></strong>&#8212;articles, 
    news, and resources. Great site, though it tends to 
    have a &quot;small business&quot; focus (vs. a high-growth 
    startup focus). Also see <strong><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/" target="_blank">WSJ's VC-related blog.</a></strong></li>
