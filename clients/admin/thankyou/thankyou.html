<p>We would like to personally thank each of you for giving up your 
valuable time Friday evening in order to attend the Simple Software 
Launch celebration. It was a resounding success!  We'd like to 
extend a special "thanks" to the awesome catering crew from the newly
opened Mission restaurant: "Locavore".  Their chef and crew stepped in 
at the last minute to save the day after our previous arrangements 
fell through.  They were able to put together an amazing buffet of food 
whose quality and flavor exceeded our wildest expectations.  And they 
were able to do it in only 3 short days!  Thank you Jason and Mario!
We would also like to thank the San Francisco Elks for allowing us use 
of their exquisite and historic facilities.  </p>

<p>
Your enthusiastic participation and lively conversation helped to make 
this launch a success. This was the first time we have and even though there
were some technical difficulties and we need more practice, your responses have 
been overwhelmingly positive and your feedback insightful and informative. The 
conversations and buzz in the room after the demonstration are testament to the 
potential Simple Software has to offer businesses.  If you have any follow up 
questions, please feel free to email us at info@simpsf.com. You can ask us anything!
</p>
<p>
As a token of our appreciation, we would like to offer to all those that
attended the presentation a complimentary 6 month, 5 user trial of the 
Simple Software application. We always offer a free 1-month trial
through our website at http://www.simpsf.com. However, if you would 
like a custom 6 month trial, please reply to thankyou@simplesoftwaresf.com 
with the subject "You're Welcome".
