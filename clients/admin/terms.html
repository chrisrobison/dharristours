		<p>
			<strong>11. Indemnities. </strong>&nbsp; If someone makes a claim against either you or Simple Software (&quot;Recipient&quot; which may refer to you or Simple Software depending upon which party received the Material), that any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material (&quot;Material&quot;) furnished by either you or Simple Software (&quot;Provider&quot; which may refer to you or Simple Software depending on which party provided the Material), and used by the Recipient infringes its intellectual property rights, the Provider will indemnify the Recipient against the claim if the Recipient does the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				notifies the Provider promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after the Recipient receives notice of the claim (or sooner if required by applicable law);</li>
			<li>
				gives the Provider sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and</li>
			<li>
				gives the Provider the information, authority, and assistance the Provider needs to defend against or settle the claim.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If the Provider believes or it is determined that any of the Material may have violated someone else&#39;s intellectual property rights, the Provider may choose to either modify the Material to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, the Provider may end the license for, and require return of, the applicable Material and refund any fees the Recipient may have paid for it and any unused, prepaid fees you have paid applicable to the terminated license or service. If you are the Provider and such return materially affects Simple Software&#39;s ability to meet its obligations under the relevant Order Form, then Simple Software may, at its option and upon 30 days prior written notice, terminate the Order Form. The Provider will not indemnify the Recipient if the Recipient alters the Material or uses it outside the scope of use identified in the Provider&#39;s user documentation or if the Recipient uses a version of the Materials which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Material which was provided to the Recipient. The Provider will not indemnify the Recipient to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material not furnished by the Provider. Simple Software will not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon the combination of any Material with any products or services not provided by Simple Software. This section provides the parties&#39; exclusive remedy for any infringement claims or damages.</p>
