# Master Invoices
## Consolidated Invoice Delivery

Master Invoices are simply a group of invoices that belong to the same customer. 
Many of D Harris Tours customers have multiple trips per day. If invoicing is 
completed once a month or even (optimistically) once a week, these customers 
can end up receiving dozens if not hundreds of invoice emails at the same time.

Master Invoices help solve this problem. They consolidate a group of invoices
to be sent to the customer. It is somewhat like a phone bill: a cover summary 
page and then pages and pages of call details. It is important to note that 
a Master Invoice is not an actual invoice; It is simply a summary of invoices. 
Each invoice still stands alone and must be paid in full.

This document will describe the process of creating and sending a Master Invoice
