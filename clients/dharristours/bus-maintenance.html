        <h1>BUS MAINTENANCE CHECKLISTS</h1>
<h2>PRE-TRIP INSPECTION</h2>
<p>The following pre-trip inspection checklist helps to ensure that the vehicle components are in good working condition before each trip. Pre-trip inspections cannot be performed in a short period of time. In checklist form, the sequence below may seem to be overly time consuming however, careful pre-trip inspections save time in the long run. Each checklist item is followed with detailed instructions corresponding to their checklist item number. If any system or component does not pass this inspection, it must be corrected before operating the vehicle.</p>
<h3>Apply the parking brake and chock the tires before beginning the inspection!</h3>
<h1>PRE-TRIP CHECKLIST</h1>
<ol>
    <li><b>INSPECT THE BATTERIES &amp; BATTERY CABLES.</b><br>
        <blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
            <p>BATTERY POSTS, TERMINALS AND RELATED ACCESSORIES CONTAIN LEAD COMPONENTS, CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER AND REPRODUCTIVE HARM. TO PREVENT POSSIBLE PERSONAL INJURY, ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER HANDLING BATTERY PARTS AND RELATED ACCESSORIES.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>Be sure the battery hold-down is secure. If it is loose, tighten the hold down fasteners. If they are broken, replace them.</li>
            <li>Remove any corrosion from the hold-down and the top of the battery. Use diluted ammonia or a soda solution to neutralize the acid present, then rinse off the ammonia or soda solution with clean water. If the battery posts or cable terminals are corroded, disconnect the terminals from the posts. Clean them with a soda solution and a wire brush. After cleaning, reconnect the terminals to the battery posts, and then apply a thin coat of petroleum jelly to the posts and terminals to retard corrosion.</li>
            <li>Check that all cables are secure in their P-clamps, are protected by loom, and have not shifted to be against any sharp edges.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote class='info'><div class='heading important'>&#9888; IMPORTANT</div>
            <p>TAKE CARE TO KEEP THE VENT PLUGS TIGHT (IF EQUIPPED) SO THAT THE NEUTRALIZING SOLUTION DOES NOT ENTER ANY OF THE BATTERY CELLS.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>EXAMINE THE STEERING COMPONENTS.</b><br>
        <p>Examine the steering gear mounting bolts (refer to the OEM Chassis Operator’s Manual), pitman arm nut, and the drag link nuts for tightness. Check for leakage at the gear box. Be sure the steering drive-line and the U-joints are in roadworthy condition, without cracks, breaks, looseness or other damage. Tighten loose nuts and replace damaged parts as needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK THE FLUID LEVEL IN THE COOLANT RESERVOIR.</b><br>
        <p>Check the condition of the radiator fins, and the charge air cooler.</p>
        <blockquote class='info'><div class='heading important'>&#9888; IMPORTANT</div>
            <p>COOLANT MUST BE FILLED TO THE FULL LINE OF THE SURGE TANK. LOW COOLANT COULD RESULT IN ENGINE OVERHEATING, WHICH COULD CAUSE ENGINE DAMAGE.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>If the coolant is low, check the amount of antifreeze protection. If the protection is adequate, add a 50/50 mixture of water and antifreeze.</li>
            <li>If additional protection is needed, add antifreeze only.</li>
            <li>Good air flow through the radiator core and charge air cooler is essential for proper engine cooling. The core’s fins allow air to flow through them, but are also a particle barrier which tends to collect insects and airborne debris.</li>
            <li>Inspect for clogged fins. Use compressed air or water directed from the engine side of the core to backwash any material restricting air-flow.</li>
            <li>Bent or damaged fins should be straightened to permit air flow across all areas of the cores.</li>
            <li>Repair or replace the radiator if it is leaking.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote class='info'><div class='heading important'>&#9888; IMPORTANT</div>
            <p>WHEN TRAVELING THROUGH AREAS OF HIGH INSECT CONCENTRATIONS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO CLEAN THE EXTERIOR OF THE RADIATOR CORE OR CHARGED AIR COOLER AS OFTEN AS EVERY 200 MILES (320 KM.).</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK THE CONDITION OF THE COOLANT AND HEATER HOSES.</b><br>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>Make sure the radiator inlet and outlet coolant hoses are pliable and are not cracking or bulging. Replace hoses that show signs of cracking, weakening or bulging. Replace all hoses, including the heater hoses, at the same time. Refer to the Service Parts Catalog or contact your dealer.</li>
            <li>Inspect and tighten hose clamps as necessary, but do not over tighten as hose life can be severely affected.</li>
            <li>Be sure the hose support brackets are securely fastened. Make sure the hoses are not located near sources of wear, abrasion or high heat.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK THE CONDITION OF THE DRIVE BELTS.</b><br>
        <p>Check the fan belts, alternator belt and refrigerant compressor belt for signs of glazing, wear, frayed edges, damage i.e. breaks or cracks, or oil contamination. If a belt is glazed, worn, damaged or oil soaked, replace the belt. Perform the same checks on the air compressor belt for the Intellisync suspension system.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>INSPECT ENGINE FOR LEAKS.</b><br>
        <p>Inspect the engine for fuel, oil, and coolant leaks. Correct any leaks found. Also check the air compressor, power steering system, and brake system components for leaking fluids.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK THE FLUID LEVEL IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM.</b><br>
        <p>If equipped with hydraulic brakes, check the fluid level in the hydraulic brake reservoir. If below the “low” mark, add fluid until the “full” mark
        is reached. Do not over fill. Use only brake fluid recommended by chassis manufacturer. Refer to the OEM chassis operator’s manual for detailed information.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK STEERING SYSTEM FLUID LEVEL.</b><br>
        <p>Check the fluid level in the steering system hydraulic reservoir. (Refer to the OEM Chassis Operator’s Manual for dipstick markings). If needed, fill the reservoir to a level between the MIN MAX marks on the indicator.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK ENGINE OIL LEVEL.</b><br>
        <p>The engine oil level should show between the upper and lower marks on the dipstick. Add enough oil to bring the level up to the operating range. Refer to the Engine Manufacturer’s Operation and Maintenance Manual for recommended lubricants and capacities.</p>
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>MAINTAIN THE CORRECT ENGINE OIL LEVEL. OPERATING THE ENGINE WITH THE OIL LEVEL BELOW THE LOW MARK, OR ABOVE THE HIGH MARK, COULD RESULT IN ENGINE DAMAGE. REFER TO THE OEM CHASSIS OPERATOR’S MANUAL FOR DIPSTICK FLUID LEVEL MARKINGS AND DIPSTICK FLUID LEVEL MARKINGS FIGURE.</p>
</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK TRANSMISSION FLUID LEVEL.</b><br>
        <p>With the vehicle on a level surface, check the fluid level in the transmission using one of the following procedures.</p>
        <p>&#9432; The fluid must be warm to ensure an accurate reading. The fluid level rises as temperature increases.</p>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li><b>HOT CHECK.</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Operate the transmission in a drive range until normal operating temperature, 160°F to 200°F (71°C to 93°C), is reached.</li>
                    <li>Put the vehicle into Park. Let the engine run at idle.</li>
                    <li>Pull out the transmission dipstick and wipe it clean, then re-insert it into the filler tube all the way until it stops. Pull out the dipstick and check where the fluid level is on the dipstick. A safe operating level is any level within the “HOT” band (upper) on the dipstick. Refer to the OEM Operator’s Manual for information on dipstick markings.</li>
                    <li>If the fluid is not within this range, add or drain fluid as needed to bring the level to the top of the “HOT” band. Refer to the OEM Operator’s Manual for approved transmission fluids and transmission fluid capacities.</li>
                </ol>
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>HOT FLUID CAN CAUSE SERIOUS BURNS, AND DAMAGE TO EYES. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ENSURE ACCIDENTAL CONTACT WITH THE FLUID IS AVOIDED.</p>
</blockquote>
            </li>
            <li><b>COLD CHECK.</b><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>A cold check may be made when the sump temperature is 60°F to 104°F (71°C to 93°C).</li>
                    <li>Run the engine for at least one (1) minute to clear the fluid of air.</li>
                    <li>With the engine at idle speed and foot on the brake pedal, move the shift lever through each gear range, providing enough time for the gear to engage. Return the gear selector to Park.</li>
                    <li>With the engine still running at idle, pull out the dipstick and wipe it clean, then reinsert the dipstick into the filler tube until it bottoms out.</li>
                    <li>Pull out the transmission dipstick and wipe it clean, then reinsert it into the filler tube all the way until it stops. Pull out the dipstick and check where the fluid level is on the dipstick. A safe operating level is any level within the “COLD” band (lower) on the dipstick. Refer to the OEM Chassis Operator’s Manual for dipstick markings.</li>
                    <li>If the fluid is not within this range, add or drain fluid as needed to bring the level to the top of the “COLD” band. Refer to the OEM Operator’s Manual for approved transmission fluids and transmission fluid capacities.  As soon as possible, check the fluid using “hot check” procedure.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>INSPECT FUEL TANKS AND COMPONENTS.</b><br>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>Inspect the fuel tank(s) and fuel line connection. If equipped, be sure the fuel tank shut off valves are open.</li>
            <li>Replace leaking fuel tank(s); repair or replace any lines or connections that are leaking. If equipped with fuel tank shut off valves, be sure the valves are fully open.
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>NEVER OPERATE THE ENGINE WITH THE FUEL TANK SHUT-OFF VALVES PARTLY CLOSED. THIS COULD DAMAGE THE FUEL PUMP, CAUSING SUDDEN LOSS OF ENGINE POWER, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY DUE TO REDUCED ENGINE CONTROL.</p>
</blockquote>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK FUEL LEVEL IN FUEL TANKS AND BE SURE THE FUEL CAP VENT AREA IS CLEAN.</b><br>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>To keep condensation to a minimum, fill the fuel tanks at the end of each day, but not to more than 95% of liquid capacity. Select the proper grade of fuel as specified by the engine manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Always strain or filter fuel before putting it into the tank(s). This will lengthen the life of the engine fuel filter and reduce the chances of dirt entering the engine.</li>
            <li>Before installing the fuel cap check the vent line for debris. Clean the area around the fuel tank cap with a clean rag, or if necessary, clean with solvent.
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>ON DIESEL FUELED VEHICLES, USE ONLY ULTRA-LOW SULFUR DIESEL (ULSD) WITH A SULFUR CONTENT OF 15PPM MAXIMUM. FAILURE TO USE ULSD MAY VOID THE WARRANTY AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO ENGINE AND EMISSION COMPONENTS.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>DO NOT MIX GASOLINE OR ALCOHOL WITH DIESEL FUEL. THIS MIXTURE COULD CAUSE AN EXPLOSION. WHEN FILLING FUEL TANK(S), DO NOT SMOKE OR USE AN OPEN FLAME NEAR THE FUEL TANKS; COMBUSTION OF DIESEL FUEL OR FUEL VAPORS COULD RESULT. NEVER FILL THE FUEL TANKS TO MORE THAN 95% OF THEIR LIQUID CAPACITY. THIS COULD MAKE THEM MORE LIKELY TO RUPTURE FROM IMPACT, POSSIBLY CAUSING FIRE AND RESULTING IN SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH BY BURNING.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading important'>&#9888; IMPORTANT</div>
    <p>DO NOT CRANK THE ENGINE FOR MORE THAN 30 SECONDS AT A TIME DURING ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES. WAIT TWO (2) MINUTES AFTER EACH TRY TO ALLOW THE STARTER TO COOL. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD CAUSE STARTER DAMAGE.</p>
</blockquote>
&#9432; Before doing any of the following procedures, make sure there is an adequate amount of fuel in the fuel tank(s). Do not fill the tank(s) to more than 95% of liquid capacity.
            </li>
            <li><p>If the vehicle has been run out of fuel, the system will need to be primed before starting the engine. Ford models are equipped with electric fuel pumps that remove the need to prime the system manually. Before restarting an engine that has run out of fuel, turn the key to “ON” for at least 30 seconds before starting the engine. Do not crank the engine for more than 30 seconds. If the engine does not start, repeat the process. If the engine does not start after three attempts, turn the key to “OFF” for at 60 seconds to allow the Engine Control Module to reset. Repeat.</p>
                <p>Refer to OEM Operator`s Manual for safe starting of your vehicle after running out of fuel for Chevy &amp; Navistar.</p>
                <p>To prevent fuel loss or entry of air into the fuel line, make sure that all fuel line connections are tight.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>DRAIN WATER FROM FUEL/ WATER SEPARATOR DAILY.</b><br>
        <p>On diesel vehicles, drain water from the fuel/water separator daily. With the engine off, open the valve by turning it two to three turns until draining occurs. Drain the filter sump of water until clear fuel is visible. Turn the valve in the opposite direction to close the drain. Tighten the valve hand tight.</p>
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN VALVE. OVER TIGHTENING CAN DAMAGE THE THREADS AND SEAL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When draining fluid from a fuel water separator, drain the fluid into an appropriate container and dispose of it properly. Many states now issue fines for draining fuel/water separators onto the ground. On all types of separators, stop draining fluid when you see fuel come out of the separator drain valve.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>INSPECT FRONT AND REAR SUSPENSION.</b><br>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>Check for broken spring leaves, loose U-bolts, cracks in the suspension brackets, and loose fasteners in the spring hangers and shackles. Inspect the shock absorbers for loose fasteners and leaks. Also, inspect the rubber air springs for unusual wear, chafing, or cracking. Ensure they are not leaking and that there are no patches (air springs are not repairable). There must be at least 1⁄2” clearance between the inflated air spring and any other part of the vehicle during normal operation.</li>
            <li>Inspect each height control valve (HCV) for any broken or bent parts, and for any loose or leaking air lines. Inspect the HCV linkage, ensuring the fixed loop linkage rods are not worn.</li>
            <li>Tighten all loose fasteners. Replace any component that is worn, cracked or otherwise damaged.
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div>
    <p>DO NOT REPLACE INDIVIDUAL LEAVES OF A DAMAGED FRONT OR REAR SUSPENSION LEAF SPRING ASSEMBLY, REPLACE THE COMPLETE SPRING ASSEMBLY.  VISIBLE DAMAGE (CRACKS OR BREAKS) TO ONE LEAF CAUSES HIDDEN DAMAGE TO OTHER LEAVES. REPLACEMENT OF ONLY THE VISIBLY DAMAGED PART(S) IS NO ASSURANCE THE SPRING IS SAFE. A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL COULD OCCUR. FAILURE TO REPLACE A DAMAGED ASSEMBLY COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT RESULTING IN SERIOUS INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE.</p>
</blockquote>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK STEERING WHEEL FOR EXCESSIVE PLAY.</b><br>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>With the front tires straight ahead, turn the steering wheel until motion is observed at the front wheels.</li>
            <li>Align a reference mark on the ruler, and then slowly turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction until motion is again detected at the wheels.</li>
            <li>Measure the lash (free-play) at the rim of the steering wheel. (Refer to the OEM Chassis Operator’s Manual.)</li>
            <li>Excessive lash exists if steering wheel movement exceeds 4 3⁄4 inch (121mm) with an 18 inch (470 mm) steering wheel. If there is excessive lash, check the steering system for wear or incorrect adjustment of the linkage and steering gear before operating the vehicle.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>CHECK ENGINE OIL PRESSURE WARNING SYSTEM.</b><br>
        <ol type='A'>
            <li>When the engine is started, the oil pressure warning will come “On” until the oil pressure rises above a preset minimum.</li>
            <li>If the warning system does not come on when the ignition is turned “On”, repair the system.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>MAKE SURE THE ELECTRIC HORN IS OPERATING PROPERLY.</b><br></li>
    <li><b>CHECK WINDSHIELD WIPER OPERATION, INCLUDING FLUID LEVEL.</b><br></li>
    <li><b>CHECK THE OPERATION OF THE BACKUP ALARM.</b><br>
        <p>Make sure the backup alarm (if equipped) is operating properly.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>INSPECT EXTERIOR LIGHTING.</b><br>
        <p>Turn “On” the headlights; inspect both high and low beams. Inspect turn, stop, backup, and side marker and clearance lights; replace if not working.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>INSPECT INTERIOR LIGHTING.</b><br>
        <p>If any of the instrument panel gauge bulbs, the dome lights, step-well light, reading lights, rear luggage compartment light (if equipped) or the right/left hand turn indicator light bulbs are not working, replace them.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>INSPECT THE TIRES.</b><br>
        <p>Check tire pressure and inspect each tire for bulges, cracks, cuts or punctures. The load and cold inflation pressure must not exceed the rim or wheel manufacturer’s recommendations, even though the tire may be approved for a higher load or inflation. Some rims and wheels are stamped with a maximum load and maximum cold inflation rating. If they are not stamped, consult the rim or wheel manufacturer for the correct tire inflation pressure for the vehicle load. If the load exceeds the maximum rim or wheel capacity, the load must be adjusted or reduced.</p>
<ol type='A'>
    <li>Check the inflation pressure of the tires before each trip, using an accurate tire pressure gauge. Tires should be checked when cool. The correct pressure for each tire is provided on the manufacturer’s certification label. Keep tires inflated to the applicable pressure.  Be sure the valve stem caps are on every tire and that they are screwed on finger tight.  Over-inflation gives the treaded surface of the tire a convex shape (Refer to the OEM Operator’s Manual for tire figures). This causes extreme tire wear in the middle part of the tire.  If a tire has been run under-inflated, check the wheel for damage to wheel, rim or tire before adding air.
<blockquote class='info'><div class='heading caution'>&#9432; CAUTION</div><p>DO NOT OPERATE THE VEHICLE WITH UNDER-INFLATED OR OVER-INFLATED TIRES. INCORRECT INFLATION CAN STRESS THE TIRES AND MAKE THE TIRE AND RIMS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE, FAILURE AND LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL, RESULTING IN SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH.</P></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Moisture inside a tire can result in body ply separation or a sidewall rupture. During tire inflation, compressed air reservoirs and lines must be kept dry. Use well maintained in-line moisture traps and service them regularly.</li>
<li>Inspect the tires for bulges, cracks, cuts or penetrations. A tire pressure check will assist in uncovering hidden damage. A weekly pressure loss of 4 psi (28 kPa) or more in a tire may indicate damage and the tire should be inspected and repaired or replaced.</li>
<li><p>If tires are wearing irregularly, rotate them and have the vehicle’s alignment checked to determine the cause of irregular tire wear. Government regulations mandate that front axle tires have no less than 4/32-inch (3 mm) of tread depth when measured at any point in a major tread groove. The same rules mandate rear axle tires to have no less than 2/32-inch (1.5 mm) of tread depth when measured at any point in a major tread groove. Check state or provincial regulations in case more stringent regulations apply.</p>
    <p>&#9432; Refer to the OEM Chassis Operator’s Manual for checking tire inflation pressure, front axle rotation, dual axle rotation and wheel nut tightening sequence drawings.</p></li>
<li>Tires should be inspected for oil contamination. Fuel oil, gasoline, and other petroleum derivatives, if allowed to contact the tires, will soften the rubber and destroy the tire.</li>
</ol>
<li><b>CHECK FOR LOOSE WHEEL LUG NUTS AND WHEEL COMPONENTS.</b><br>
    <ol type='A'>
        <li><p>Check the wheel nuts or rim nuts for indications of looseness. Remove all dirt and foreign material from the wheel assembly.</p>
            <p>&#9432; Dirt or rust streaks from the stud holes, metal buildup around the stud holes or out-of-round or worn stud holes may be caused by loose wheel lug nuts.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Replace broken, cracked, badly worn, bent, rusty or sprung rings and rims. Be sure that the rim base, lock-ring and side ring are matched according to the size and type.</p>

    <p>INSUFFICIENT WHEEL NUT (RIM NUT) TORQUE CAN CAUSE WHEEL SHIMMY, RESULTING IN WHEEL DAMAGE, STUD BREAKAGE, AND EXTREME TIRE TREAD WEAR. EXCESSIVE WHEEL NUT TORQUE CAN BREAK STUDS, DAMAGE THREADS AND CRACK DISCS IN THE STUD HOLE AREA. USE THE RECOMMENDED TORQUE VALUES AND FOLLOW THE PROPER TIGHTENING SEQUENCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#9432; On each wheel stud, the end that faces away from the vehicle may be stamped with an “L” or “R” depending on which side of the vehicle the stud is installed. Studs stamped with a “L” are left-handed threaded and are installed on the “Roadside” of the vehicle. Studs stamped with an “R” are right-hand threads and are installed on the “Curbside” of the vehicle.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li><b>TEST THE SERVICE BRAKES.</b><br>
    <p>Test the service brakes before leaving the lot. Depress the brake pedal, release the parking brake, and check that the brake system warning light goes “OUT”. If the warning light remains “ON” after releasing the parking brake, correct the problem before driving off. When safe to do so, drive the vehicle a short distance and make a firm application of the service brake pedal. If there is any pulling to one side or the other, correct the problem before continuing.</p>
</li>
<li><b>TEST THE PARKING BRAKE.</b><br>
    <p>Test the parking brake on a 20% grade. Apply the parking brake with the vehicle on a 20% grade (or as steep of a grade that the vehicle may normally be parked on). The ramp surface should be made of Portland cement or equivalent. If the parking brake does not hold the vehicle, repair the parking brake system.</p>
</li>
<li><b>CYCLE THE MOBILITY LIFT.</b><br>
    <p>Open and inspect paratransit door. Ensure there is enough clearance to deploy the wheelchair lift. Cycle the lift, fully deploying and stowing it each time to its full-stop positions. If the lift doesn’t reach full-stop it can slack in-between cycles and not be in the locked position, causing rattle and premature wear on lift parts. Run through full lift function daily from each of the control locations.</p>
</li>
<li><b>INSPECT CONDITION OF FLOORING, INCLUDING HEATER HOSE COVERS OR FLOOR HEATERS.</b><br>
    <p>Inspect the condition of all floor rubber, looking for seams that are pulling up, trim that is detached, or any other trip hazard. Correct as necessary. Also inspect the floor mounted heaters. Ensure that their casings are not damaged and ensure all heater hose covers are in place.</p>
</li>
<li><b>INSPECT A/C HOSES AND CLAMPS FOR TIGHTNESS.</b><br>
    <p>Inspect the AC hoses, ensuring they are not cracked, leaking, worn, or against a sharp edge. Inspect the clamps for security. AC connections using a clamp will be located under the hood, under the floor behind the driver side door, at the condensers, and at the evaporators.</p>
</li>
<li><b>CHECK FOR PROPER OPERATION OF THE REAR DOOR, ENTRY DOOR, AND ALL EMERGENCY EXITS.</b><br>
    <p>Inspect the rear door, checking that it travels unimpeded through its full range of motion. Check it from both the interior and exterior to assess the condition of each latch. Ensure that it is unlocked before operating the vehicle, and make sure the ajar/locked buzzer and light works, if equipped. Inspect all seals, looking for tears, accumulation of debris, and proper contact with sealing surfaces. Check that the prop operates smoothly and holds the door in its full open position.</p>
    <p>Inspect the entry door, checking that it moves smoothly through its full range of motion. Inspect all seals, again looking for tears, accumulation of debris, and proper contact with sealing surfaces. Check the door for proper operation in both powered (if equipped) and manual modes of operation. Ensure that all related lighting activates when the door is opened. Operate all additional emergency exits and make sure their buzzers and indicators work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>FINAL WALK-AROUND</h2>
<ol>
    <li>With the parking brake applied, check service and emergency exits. They should all open, close, seal and secure properly.</li>
    <li>Inspect seats and floor for debris or damage.</li>
    <li>Verify that all interior and exterior lights are functional.</li>
    <li>Inspect the engine compartment for fluid leaks while the engine is running.</li>
    <li>Verify that all windows, access panels and emergency equipment are in place and in proper working order.</li>
    <li>Inspect the underside of the bus and make sure it is clear of obstructions. Always check the rear of the vehicle if backing up is required.</li>
    <li>Check the wheelchair lift for function. Report any problems to service personnel.</li>
