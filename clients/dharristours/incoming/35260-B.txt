I was told one bus dropped off girls soccer. Then dropped off girls
basketball. Because of that drop off the were late getting back to girls
soccer. And then they were suppose to come back to get girls basketball.

As for the discount, it was a couple weeks back there was mix ups 3 or 4
times in a row for girls soccer. Patrick let me know he would discount two
trips that day. 1 for boys soccer and 1 for girls soccer. Thank you.
