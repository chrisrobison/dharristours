Hi Mrs. Harris,

Our students are now back from Loma Mar Outdoor School and they had a
wonderful trip, thank you!

I'm writing because I noticed on the way back to Highland on Friday 2/7,
our students were piled into one bus. The problem with this is:
1. There were not enough seats
2. Highland paid for TWO buses.
Since you were not able to provide two buses, please send us the quoted
$1444.92 that we were charged for the additional bus.

Thank you,
Poppy Sheldon
