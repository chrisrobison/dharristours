Patrick-- there does not appear to be an order or agreement to change
venue.  Cassandra will have to agree to it, or at least her lawyer will
have to agree to it, by stipulation.   If Cassandra is non-responsive
and her lawyer doesn't feel she can agree without Casssandra's input,
we'll have to file a motion to change venue. It's a very easy thing, but
a lag time of about 6 weeks to get to court, and a very short lag time
of about two weeks to get the case transferred.  If you feel you'd do
better in SF with this parentage case (the SC case is a parentage
case)   Eventually your dependency case should go away and be replaced
by the parentage one.

A judge would justifiably be worried-- serious accusations against you by Cassandra, and now serious mental health concerns about her.  It's one thing to send the case back to Santa Cruz, and another to send it to another court room in the same courthouse (or at least same system), where all the experts are already familiar with everything about the case.
