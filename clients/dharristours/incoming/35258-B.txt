Hello,

I am a teacher at Wallenberg High School in SFUSD and am organizing an
overnight field trip for my students to go on college tours. I was told by
the transportation office to reach out directly to the SPAB providers
(charter busses) to ask for an estimate and select a provider.

Below I have outlined our trip. The trip ID is 4207 for your reference.
Please let me know if your company is able to meet our needs and send me an
estimate.

Thank you,
Charlotte Sewell
