The balance when we billed on November 7 was $2729, and I applied a
discount of $329 to reduce it to $2400.

That discount was NOT put on the bill when we mailed bills December 19. 
That showed the balance of $2729, when it should have been $2400.  And
we credited you with a payment of $1000 on 11/12, which should have
brought the balance to $1400.

The January 23rd bill shows a balance of $1776, which should be $1400. 
If you want to pay it today, I'll knock off another $200, making it $1200.

Do you expect any more legal action in Santa Cruz?

A judge would justifiably be worried-- serious accusations against you by Cassandra, and now serious mental health concerns about her.  It's one thing to send the case back to Santa Cruz, and another to send it to another court room in the same courthouse (or at least same system), where all the experts are already familiar with everything about the case.
