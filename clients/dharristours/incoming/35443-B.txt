Hi Juana!

This is Eliot Smith, the Athletic Director for Lick-Wilmerding High School.

I was hoping to rent a bus to take our varsity boys basketball team.  12 players and 2 adults  up to Arcata High School tomorrow.

We would get picked up tomorrow morning at 8:30 a.m. at Lick-Wilmerding high School.

We would travel up to Arcata.  We are staying at the Comfort Inn.  we did get a room for the driver.

We would need the driver to drive us to a gym to shoot around at around 4 p.m. and then to the game at 7 p.m. at the High School.

We would then stay at the Comfort Inn Wednesday night and then head back home on Thursday morning.


Thanks

Eliot
