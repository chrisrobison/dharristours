Hi Juana

Due to continuing drop in attendance in our services over the past several
weeks due to the coronavirus situation the church leadership team has
decided to temporary suspend the operating shuttles services . So
effectively immediately ( starting Sunday 2/23 ) there will be no shuttle
services. Please cancel all buses UNTIL we give you notice of when we will
resume.

Thank you for your understanding and we will be in contact again once
conditions improves.
