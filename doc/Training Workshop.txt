Training Workshop

In this workshop, we will walk through some "real world" scenarios and show you how to solve them using Simple Software. Let's say we own a tour bus company and provide tours around the Bay Area.

Scenario #1
Task: create a new folder called 'Work' for tracking customers and jobs 
Step #1
	Click on Administration and then click on App Manager
Step #2
	Create a new module called 'Work'.
Step #3
	In the 'Module Editor', expand 'Advanced' and set 'Access' to 1 and then click 'Save'.
Step #4
	Go to Users and select your login. Click on the checkbox next to the 'Work' module, if it isn't already checked, and then click save. 
Step #5
	Logoff and then log back in.

Scenario #2
Task: track our customers

Step #1
	Open DB Tool
****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** ****** 
The database tool allows you to view and add new tables as well as import data into new or existing tables. You can also add or change fields in existing tables. Follow SQL naming standards (no spaces or special charactres) and Simple Software standards. Name fields using descriptive words, try to avoid prepositions, and capitalize each word (StartDate). Each table will have several columns automatically created and should NOT be changed. For instance if you create a table called 'Business', these columns are added by the system: BusinessID (auto-incrementing integer), Business (used in drop-down list when forms are generated by the system), Description, Notes. There are also system columns added to the table that are not editable: (Created, LastModified, CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy). These columns are populated with the date and user that creates or modifies a record.

Step #2
	Click 'New Table'
Step #3
	Name the table 'Business', select the Module 'Work' in the drop down list and then choose an icon. Click 'Create Table' at the bottom when done.
Step #4
	The 'Business' table will appear down below. Expand the table and click on the empty box under 'Notes'. Type 'Address' (keep 'Short Text' as the field type), then click the save icon to the left. Repeat for City, State, Zip and Phone.

You may need to grant yourself access to the process the way you did in Scenario #1

Step #5
	After you are done creating your table, you can start adding your customers. Under the 'Work' module on the left navigation pane, you will see a process named 'Business'. Click on the process and a new tabl will appear in your work area. The grid will be empty because there are no records in the table. Click on 'New' and fill out the columns for 'Outdoor Adventures'. Repeat for 'SF Fun in the Sun', 'Muir Woods Sightseeing', 'Santa Cruz Wharf'.

Scenario #3
Task: track jobs for the customers we created

Step #1
	Open DB Tool
Step #2
	Create a table called 'Job' with columns StartDate as datetime, StartTime as short text, EndTime as short text, and BusinessID as number.
Step #3
	Link the Job table to the Business table by dragging the Job table on top of the Business table. Make sure to grab it by the table name. The arrows icon to the left of the name allows you to move it around the screen. After you drop it on the Business table, a dialogue box will appear asking if you want to link the tables. Click 'OK'.
Step #4
	Open the 'Job' process and add a new job. You will notice that a dropdown list of Businesses will appear in the form that was automatically generated for you by the sytem. This is one of the magical things that Simple Software does simply by having a column end with 'ID'. The other thing you should notice is when you go to add a start date, a calendar will appear to assist you.
Step #5
	We are going to relate it to the business to show you an innovative way of building complex systems without inhibiting daily routines. After saving the record, click the 'Relate' button. This will pop up a dialogue box with a list of processes you have access to. Find 'Business' in the list and then select the business that you chose for the job you created. 
Step #6
	Go back to Business tab and find the business in the grid. Select the business and look at the bottom to view all of the jobs that this company has provided for you. This can help in many areas and is a new way relating information for any reason.
