As this market has developed over the last several years, the value proposition driving adoption has also evolved. In application hosting's original incarnation, the reasons for contracting with a service provider largely mirrored the motivation for any other outsourcing relationship: more predictable costs and a greater ability to focus on core competencies while leveraging the expertise of a specialist service provider. These core principles are quite similar to the software as a service value proposition where an affordable, “pay-as-you-go” relationship provides small- and mid-size organizations with a suite of enterprise applications that are similar to those available to Global 1000 organizations and a service relationship with the provider that ensures ongoing value. However, we believe revisiting a few of the key principles and the evolving trend toward a range of enhanced value drivers is important in understanding the differentiation between SaaS and licensing models. These value drivers include:

    * Lower cash outlays for enterprise-class software purchases by replacing large, upfront cash outlays for software licenses with a smaller, subscription based pricing model that is much more frequent but at a fraction of the cost. Such a shift in pricing moves a great deal of enterprises' expenditures from fixed costs to variable costs, increasing the flexibility of their cost structures.
    * Ease of implementation and quicker time-to-market with deployments generally requiring less than three months compared to 6 to 18 months with traditional software. The focus of a deployment is on end-user training and acceptance, since customers do not have to install or maintain servers, networking equipment, security products, or other hardware.
    * Reduced technology investment risk and higher ROI with lower upfront capital, resource commitment, and levels of complexity. The customer avoids the risk of additional 'hidden costs' that creep up over the application lifecycle such as ongoing support and maintenance costs, upgrades, user acceptance risks, etc. Many on-demand providers are able to provide a break-even point in six months or less while licensing models require a longer payback period. In some regards, the timing for software as a service could not be any more opportune with small and large companies alike trying to maximize every dollar spent on IT and demanding a clear and measurable ROI before each investment decision is made.
    * Frees up internal resources by reducing internal IT staff required to manage applications, keep track of upgrades, maintain performance, etc.
    * Full application lifecycle involvement, from initial deployment through ongoing support, maintenance and upgrade, ensures that there is a complete alignment of interests with the SaaS firm having a vested stake in the success of the application beyond initial deployment. Consequently, SaaS firms are redefining the relationships with clients by managing the application and the client relationship over the full lifecycle of use.
    * Continuous support and seamless upgrades with new features and functionality, upgrades, customer support, and other operational services all included instead of being treated as incremental costs.
    * Shared risks and single-source accountability with customers demanding a different vendor relationship that results in more accountability and flexibility in the actual execution of the software. Just as importantly, the SaaS firm 'shares' in the execution risk of the application, since the SaaS provider also earns their own return over the term of the relationship and consequently 'loses' in the equation when customers are dissatisfied and seek other alternatives.
    * New functionality and improved application performance with on-demand firms receiving continual client feedback in a service-based relationship and often interacting with end-users in the application environment itself to determine priorities for new features and to fix bugs and glitches. A critical differentiator is that new product revisions are made more frequently - three to four times a year or more - compared to one new release every 12 to 18 months with traditional software. Consequently, software as a service providers are able to continually refine the product with new releases that add customer-driven functionality that can be utilized by all clients in a shared application and across a multi-tenant model. Major new product releases and application improvements can literally be made overnight or during off-hours such as weekends resulting in little service disruption for end-users.
    * Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) with licensing, implementation, customization, maintenance, upgrades, hardware and support costs being bundled into an on-demand service relationship. The first year total cost of ownership can be five to ten times less expensive than enterprise software with the majority of savings resulting from the elimination of upfront integration and customization projects (see Figure 5). Thus, the payback period is considerably shortened. The lack of large implementation opportunities poses special challenges for SaaS firms seeking to draw on partnerships and alliances with top-tier consulting firms that thrive on providing these types of upfront services. While harder to quantify due to 'hidden' costs, the SaaS model is also based on a longer-term value.

The application's functionality and ability to address end-users' needs remain important factors in any technology expenditure decision. That being said, the key point is that the cost and the success of the application's operation are crucial factors in evaluating hosted applications versus license. As these core tenets become commonplace, their relative value becomes somewhat less valuable over time and another set of critical success factors rises to the surface. While still early, we believe that a higher-level rationale is evolving that combines these “base case” factors already mentioned with other important business and technology issues. Such issues include access to best-of-breed vertical- and process-specific solutions, support for standards-based integration that leverages Web services protocols, new levels of customization combining unique workflow requirements, and a concern for enhanced client service and account management.

Going beyond these factors, however, the top-performing software as a service firms derive their success, at least in part, from their ability to reconcile the tension between the two sides of their business - in other words, to transform the software purchase process into a longterm, intensive, service-based relationship. As we will discuss in subsequent sections, this ability is precisely what makes the SaaS model so disruptive to the traditional software model. Figure 6 illustrates this concept, depicting how software delivered as a service draws out “the best of both worlds” from each model and where the lines of demarcation between software and services are becoming much more blurred. It is possible the model will bifurcate at some point, with enterprise clients signing up for full-feature, process-oriented services bundled around hosted technology platforms, and SMEs adopting best-of-breed applications addressing a particular niche.
